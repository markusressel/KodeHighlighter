# How to use
Have a look at the demo app (`app`  module) for a complete sample.

## Simple example

```kotlin
val markdownText = readResourceFileAsText(R.raw.markdown_sample)
val markdownRuleBook = MarkdownRuleBook()
val markdownHighlighter = SpannableHighlighter(markdownRuleBook, DarkBackgroundColorScheme())

CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
    val spannable = withContext(Dispatchers.Default) {
        val spannable = createSpannable(text)
        markdownHighlighter.highlight(spannable)
        spannable
    }
    target.text = spannable
}
```

## Working with `EditText`
When using this library with an `EditText` view, previously applied styles need to be removed
when the highlighting is updated due to a text change. To make it easy for you to deal with this
the `EditTextHighlighter` class can be used:

```kotlin
val editTextHighlighter = EditTextHighlighter(
        target = editTextMarkdownDark,
        languageRuleBook = MarkdownRuleBook())
editTextHighlighter.start()

CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
    val markdown = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        readResourceFileAsText(R.raw.markdown_sample)
    }
    editTextMarkdownDark.setText(markdown)
}
```

You can then set or edit any text you like and the highlighting will refresh automatically.

## Gradle
To use this library just include it in your dependencies using

```groovy
repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

in your project build.gradle file and

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...

    def codeHighlighterVersion = "v2.0.0"
    implementation("com.github.markusressel.KodeHighlighter:core:${codeHighlighterVersion}")
}
```

in your desired module ```build.gradle``` file.


## Syntax highlighting

### Language Autodetection

Currently there is no auto detection for the language used in a text.

### Integrated language rule books

This library includes rule books for a small set of languages for you to use right away, without
spending time to think about finding the right tokens and color schemes:

* java
* json
* kotlin
* markdown
* python

To include one of them in your project, just pick the ones you would like to use
and - **in addition** to the `core` module - import them as a dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...

    implementation("com.github.markusressel.KodeHighlighter:java:${codeHighlighterVersion}")
    implementation("com.github.markusressel.KodeHighlighter:json:${codeHighlighterVersion}")
    implementation("com.github.markusressel.KodeHighlighter:kotlin:${codeHighlighterVersion}")
    implementation("com.github.markusressel.KodeHighlighter:markdown:${codeHighlighterVersion}")
    implementation("com.github.markusressel.KodeHighlighter:python:${codeHighlighterVersion}")
    [etc.]
```

### Writing a custom rule book

A `LanguageRuleBook` consists of a **default color scheme** and a **set of rules** that provide
information on how to style different parts of the `Spannable`. Have a look at how the
[MarkdownRuleBook](markdown/src/main/java/de/markusressel/kodehighlighter/language/markdown/MarkdownRuleBook.kt)
is implemented to get a feel for how to implement it yourself.

### Styling

Different highlighting styles for a given language can be achieved
by implementing the `ColorScheme` interface and passing it to the highlighter
(f.ex. a `SpannableHighlighter`). For more info on how to do this have a look at the
[DarkBackgroundColorScheme from the Markdown rule book](markdown/src/main/java/de/markusressel/kodehighlighter/language/markdown/colorscheme/DarkBackgroundColorScheme.kt).
